# cs32-proj2 (Colosseum Game)

This game is a survival colosseum game. The object is to survive as long as possible without being overwhelmed by the enemies flowing in from the perimeter.

### Compiling
- Make your way to the `src/` directoy.
- Run `make Prog` to compile the Colosseum game.
- Run `./Prog` to begin the game and enjoy.
- Simply close the game window to stop the game.

### Controls
> Control your character (green) that spawns in the center of the colosseum with `w`,`a`,`s`, and `d` for standardized movement.
> Then use `q` and `e` to rotate your character to use your sword, `[space]` (NOT IMPLEMENTED), to kill your enemies at close range.

### Enemies
> Enemies spawn at the perimeter of the arena and immediately begin moving towards the `PLAYER`'s positions. They will die when they are touched by your sword projectile (NOT IMPLEMENTED) or the `PLAYER` but be careful as touching them will hurt you as well.
